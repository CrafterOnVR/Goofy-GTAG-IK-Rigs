# Goofy-GTAG-IK-Rigs
the rigs i got were from @NachoEngine
At first, you may not see anything.
So first, you'll see the X, Y, Z, -X, -Y, and -Z viewpoints.
You should see and options menu, and above it, 4 circles.
Hover over all of them until you see viewport shading that looks shiny. (the last one)
then click it
